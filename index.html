        <h3>Music Production</h3>
        <p>As a child I played piano but was not very good at it but always retained a love for music - even to this day. When the COVID pandemic started, I thought about how cool it would be to make my own music so I bought FL Studio and
          have been making tracks in my spare time. I find it to be a fun, productive way for me to express myself and be able to think creatively.</p>

        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>After graduating college and starting my career, I had the means to invest in myself and so I
          started taking online courses in Web Development. Through this I realized how fun learning to code really could be. I was able to build a simple HTML and CSS website and I was amazed by the potential other things I could do as I dived in deeper into
          the world of coding.</p>
